# 🎨 M-Coloring Problem (Graph Coloring using Backtracking)

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the classic **M-Coloring Problem**, which determines whether a graph can be colored using at most **M** colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## ✅ Problem Description

Given an undirected graph and an integer **M**, determine if the graph can be colored with at most **M** different colors so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

---

## 🧠 Approach

- Uses **backtracking** to assign colors recursively.
- Checks if assigning a color to a vertex is valid using the `isSafe` function.
- Backtracks if a coloring leads to conflict.
