# Day 2: Merge Sort

**Problem:** [Merge Sort â€“ GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-sort/1)

**Topic:** Sorting, Divide and Conquer  
**Language Used:** C++

## Problem Description:
Implement merge sort on an array of integers. This is a classic sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer strategy.

## Approach:
- Recursively divide the array into two halves until the base case is reached.
- Merge the sorted halves by comparing elements.
- Final result is a sorted array in ascending order.

## File:
- `merge_sort.cpp`: Contains the full C++ implementation of Merge Sort.
