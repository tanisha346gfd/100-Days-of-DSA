## ✅ Problem Description

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a **palindrome**.  
Return all possible palindrome partitionings of `s`.

### 🧪 Example


---

## 🧠 Approach

- The solution uses **recursive backtracking**.
- At each index, it tries every substring and checks if it's a palindrome.
- If it is, it proceeds recursively to partition the rest of the string.
- Backtracking ensures all valid combinations are explored.
