## ðŸ“˜ Problem

Write a program to solve a 9x9 Sudoku board by filling empty cells (`'.'`) such that:

- Each digit 1â€“9 appears exactly once in every **row**, **column**, and **3x3 box**.

The board is modified **in-place**.

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

- Use **recursive backtracking**.
- At each empty cell, try digits `'1'` to `'9'`.
- For each digit:
  - Check if itâ€™s safe (not present in current row, column, or 3x3 box).
  - If safe, place it and recurse.
  - If stuck, **backtrack**.
