# ðŸŸ¢ Day 1: Generate All Binary Strings Without Consecutive 1's

ðŸ”— [GFG Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/generate-all-binary-strings/1)

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Given a number **n**, generate all binary strings of length **n** such that there are no two 1â€™s together.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

- Use **recursion** to generate all binary strings.
- Always allow appending `'0'`.
- Append `'1'` only when the last character was `'0'` (or itâ€™s the start).
- Store the results in a vector of strings.
